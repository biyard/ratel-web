### How to add a primitive component

This repository is based on [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) which utilizes tailwindcss.

Basically, Ratel web is using customized shadcn components.
you can check the shadcn config of us in the [components.json](components.json).
All shadcn components generated by shadcn CLI are placed in [src/components/ui](src/components/ui)

So, we recommend to use customized components generated by shadcn CLI if absent.

- First of all, please check if there is a customized component in [src/components/ui](src/components/ui). Then you need a new primitive component, find a component in [shadcn documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components).
- Then select a component you want to use.
- You can check the `installation` in right side menu, and copy the `pnpm` command as below.
- Finally, please customize the component as [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/YaLSz7dzRingD7CipyaC47/Ratel?node-id=1387-36270&t=2kYki60vsmefKuF4-0).
  - If you don't have access permission to the Figma, please request to @hackartists.

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add accordion
```
